 <h1>General Fertility Rate in California 2014-2020</h1>
 <p>The general fertility rate  (GFR) is the number of live births per 1,000 females of childbearing age
between the ages of 15-50 years. The U.S. birth rate has been declining since the 1970's due to social factors such as delayed marriage, widespread contraceptive use, and changes in abortion laws.
In 2020, the U.S. GFR has dropped to 55.8 births per 1,000 women, down 4% from 2019 - a new record low. </p>
 <p>The map below displays the GFR in California cities from 2014 - 2020. The data can be view by age groups or total GFR. Additionally, the search button in the top-left corner can zoom the map to the selected city.</p>
